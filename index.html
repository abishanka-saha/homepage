      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology with Dr. <a href="https://huelsing.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Andreas Hülsing</a> as my supervisor. I am currently employed under the <em><strong>T</strong>axable <strong>A</strong>autonomous <strong>L</strong>ibre <strong>E</strong>electronic <strong>R</strong>resources</em> (TALER) project, where I am working on developing efficiently scalable post-quantum blind signatures, essential for ecash systems that anonymizes the buyer.</p>
      <p>I am also working on the long-standing open problem of <em>lazy sampling a random permutation oracle that can be queried in superposition in both the forward and inverse directions</em>. My primary focus is to construct such an oracle that is both "recording" and "reprogrammable". This endeavour would result in the formulation of a quantum random permutation oracle, which can then be used to give heuristic security proofs for permutation-based cryptographic designs in the presence of quantum adversaries with bounded quantum access to these constructions.</p>
      <p>My other area of interest is quantum walk algorithms on expander graphs, and in particular, supersingular isogeny graphs. This is an attempt towards a quantum cryptanalysis of isogeny-based cryptography, exploiting the underlying graph structure and the hardness of the pathfinding problem on it.</p>
      <p>I did my Phd on Symmetric-Key Provable Security with Prof. Mridul Nandi as my supervisor at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My doctoral research focused on proving the conjectured lower bound on solutions of systems of bivariate equations resulting from beyond-birthday-bound security analyses of several PRF and PRP constructions, using the H-coefficient Technique, also known as <em>Mirror Theory</em>, and several of its variants. I have also extensively worked on indifferentiability security of several constructions (Confusion Diffusion Networks, Feistel scheme, key-alternating cipher, etc).</p>
